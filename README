Color-Spectrum-Multi

A very simple wrapper around Color::Spectrum, to make fading between more than
two colours simple and pleasant.

See Color::Spectrum's documentation - the only difference using
Color::Spectrum::Multi is that you can supply as many colours as you wish.

For instance, you could fade from red, through yellow, to green:

my $spectrum = Color::Spectrum::Multi->new;
my @colors = $spectrum->generate(15, '#FF0000', '#FFEE00', '#00FF00');
